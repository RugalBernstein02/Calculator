# Calculator
## About
This webpage was created as part of my work for the FNB App Academy program. This is a basic calculator made to learn, practice and demonstrate my JavaScript skills, but also includes HTML and CSS.

## Special features
### Clear
When you make a mistake or want to abort the current calculation, you can use the `C` and `AC` buttons. Press `C` to clear the display, but keep the current calculation. Press `AC` to clear everything.

### Repeat
When you have done a calculation, you may press the `=` key to perform the same operator again on the result. For example, to multiply by 3 repeatedly: 

1. Input `2` `âœ•` `3` `=`.
2. Press `=` again. The calculator will multiply the result, 6, by 3 again.
3. You can keep pressing `=` to multiply the last result by 3, yielding 54, 162, 486, and so on.

### Memory
A number can be saved to memory to be reused at a later time. Only one number can be stored at a time. Use `M+` to store a number, or to add to the number already in memory, `MR` to recall the stored number for using in calculations, and MC to clear the memory. The 'M' in the top-left corner turns green when a number is saved, and is white if there is no number in memory.

### Keyboard input
If you're using a physical keyboard, you can type instead of using the onscreen keyboard. In addition to the usual keys (digits 0 - 9, add, subtract, divide, multiply), the following key bindings are set:
|Function       |Key                        |
|---------------|---------------------------|
|Correction     |`c`                        |
|Clear all      |`x`                        |
|Add to memory  |Hold `m`, then press `+`   |
|Recall memory  |Hold `m`, then press `r`   |
|Clear memory   |Hold `m`, then press `c`   |

Additionally, keyboard users can use the `Backspace` key (not available on the onscreen keyboard) to remove one digit from the input.
